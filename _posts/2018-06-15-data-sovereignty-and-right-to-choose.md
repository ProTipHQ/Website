aaronpk> like even if that is just that you link to your protip.is profile from your website
aaronpk> the clear path would be add your name to indieweb examples here https://indieweb.org/payment then describe that you link to your protip.is profile, then you can make a page for protip and describe it

rev3rse> yah, i'm going to make some plugins for workdpress, ghost, etc.. and was going to use microformats and any other IWC concepts opotunistically
aaronpk> sweet
rev3rse> but on that note, your Pay page on your site
rev3rse> are you actively working on that?
aaronpk> I mean, it works, and I intend to fix it if it breaks, but I dont have any immediate plans for it
aaronpk> I am pretty pleased that it turns into an apple pay button if you look at it in safari or on ios :)
rev3rse> it's too bad googling "pay aaronpk" pulls up Squares page first
aaronpk> whoa haha
rev3rse> duckduckgo doesn't even show your page in results
aaronpk> ah probably because I don't have "aaronpk" in the title of my page
rev3rse> that a clear case where a data broker like GOOG algorithm shows bias / favoritism
aaronpk> i'm gonna change my page title and see if that helps
aaronpk> hah this tweet shows up in my search results too https://twitter.com/brennannovak/status/232725378924441600

rev3rse> typing "pay aaron parecki" makes it first result on both engines
aaronpk> lol and this https://github.com/aaronpk/checks
rev3rse> that's cool
aaronpk> I keep meaning to turn that into a little web service
aaronpk> i've been using that code since like 2006
rev3rse> somehow you ever talked about that
aaronpk> printing my own checks?
aaronpk> it freaks some people out lol
rev3rse> yah, I can see the non-hacker being freaked
rev3rse> hacker-me says- oh a check is just some numbers in a certain font placed in a specific place on a piece of paper :P
aaronpk> I think people dont realize how little pre-security there is in checks
aaronpk> all the security is done after the check is cashed, mostly in the legal system
